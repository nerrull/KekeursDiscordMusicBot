Voici mes joueurs sur le marché des échanges. Je suis principalement intéressé par un goaler, mais toute offre raisonnable sera acceptée:

Evgeny Kuznetsov (Attaquant des Capitals): 7,200M // 30 pts en 28 games, joue sur la ligne d'Ovy

Nicklas Backstrom (Attaquant des Capitals): 9,200M // revient d'une blessure et n'a joué qu'un match (1A 1PPP 5SOG 2Hit)

Chandler Stephenson (Attaquant de Vegas): 2,750M // 11pts dans ses 10 dernières games, 4PPP. Lent début de saison mais il se réchauffe

Ivan Barbashev (Attaquant des Blues) 2,250M // Poor man's Tarasenko, mais a 12pts à ses 10 dernières games


Shea Theodore (Défenseur de Vegas): 5,200M // 11pts à ses 10 dernières games, 5PPP. Surement l'offre la plus alléchante de la gang

Devon Toews (Défenseur du Colorado): 4,100M // 20pts en 16 games, dans l'ombre de Cale Makar, mais il produit autant


Anthony Stolarz (Goaler d'Anaheim): 0,950M // Backup de John Gibson, mais a 2 shutouts en 10 games pis des pas pires stats
